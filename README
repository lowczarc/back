BACK - A Forth compiler
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know why but I'm writing a Forth compiler now. It's not efficient, the
created assembly code is very bad and un-optimized, I'm directly returning x86
assembly instead of LLVM IR (bc I'm too lazy to learn) but I'm having fun ok ?
Of course, don't use it in production (or anywhere really).

What is forth ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forth is a stack-based language from the 1970s where everything is written in
reverse-polish notation.

For example, if you want to print the sum of 39 and 3 you would write

	39 3 + .

(The dot is the word for printing the top of the stack)

It's a very simple language to parse and compile, you don't need an AST for
trivial and unoptimized implementations as every word can be directly translated
to assembly. But it is still very capable of abstracting and is far more
readable than assembly.
